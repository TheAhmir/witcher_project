# witcher_project

This project analyzes the 2nd book in The Witcher series, The Sword of Destiny, and visualizes character importance in the second book of the series and the importance of characters throughout the entire series. I used Selenium to scrape the witcher wiki page. After cleaning it, I used Spacy to analyze the data and Networkx and Pyvis to visualize the data in a meaningful way.
